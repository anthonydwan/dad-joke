# dad-joke (Personal Mini Project on Practising API Usage) 
This is a project to practice basic API usage. It is based on the API project from Colt Steele's Udemy course - Python 3 Modern Bootcamp.

I have tried to refine it to make it a better experience for the user.

For example, I've:
1. added timing for text display; and
2. Making retry loops allowing user to fetch more jokes. 

With more time I hope to come up with more ideas to add features and factorise the code to refine this project.
