# dad-joke
basic practice on API usage - based on the API project from Colt Steele's Udemy course - Python 3 Modern Bootcamp

While the core idea is based off the project in the course, I have tried to refine it to make it a better experience for the user.

1. Added timing for text display
2. Making retry loops allowing user to fetch more jokes.
